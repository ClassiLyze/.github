# HR Datalab Healthcare

## Overview

HR Datalab Healthcare is the Data & AI hub for education and research in the healthcare sector at **Hogeschool Rotterdam**. Located at the Rochussenstraat campus within the **Kenniscentrum Zorginnovatie** and **Instituut voor Gezondheidszorg**, the lab focuses on the digital transformation of healthcare.

As part of Hogeschool Rotterdamâ€™s strategic agenda on digital transitions, the Datalab addresses the growing need for expertise in **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **data technologies**. It serves as a collaborative space where **researchers, educators, students, data scientists**, and **project staff** work together on healthcare innovations.

The lab supports a wide portfolio of research projects that require or benefit from the application of data technology and AI, and contributes to the development of academic staff, researchers, and students in the field.

HR Datalab Healthcare is part of a **federated structure of research data labs** within Hogeschool Rotterdam, promoting transdisciplinary collaboration and increasing the collective computational power of the labs.
